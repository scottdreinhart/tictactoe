# AGENTS.md — Repository Governance Constitution

> **Scope**: Repository-wide. This file is the top-level authority for every AI agent,
> IDE assistant, CLI tool, and CI pipeline operating in this repository.
> All other governance files inherit from and must not contradict this document.

---

## 1. Governance Precedence

1. **AGENTS.md** (this file) — supreme authority; overrides all other governance files.
2. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — repo-wide Copilot runtime policy.
3. `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` — scoped, numbered instruction files.
4. `docs/**` — human-readable reference documents (informational, not directive).

If any scoped file contradicts AGENTS.md, AGENTS.md wins.

---

## 2. Absolute Package-Manager Rule

This repository uses **pnpm exclusively**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `packageManager` | `pnpm@10.31.0` |
| `engines.node` | `24.14.0` |
| `engines.pnpm` | `10.31.0` |

### Mandatory

- Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm remove`, `pnpm update`, `pnpm exec`, `pnpm run <script>`.
- Preserve `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

### Forbidden

- Never use `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, or any non-pnpm package manager.
- Never generate `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
- Never suggest `npm install`, `npm run`, `npx`, or Yarn workflows.

---

## 3. Architecture Preservation

This project enforces **CLEAN Architecture** with three layers:

| Layer | Path | May Import | Must Not Import |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain** | `src/domain/` | `domain/` only | `app/`, `ui/`, React, any framework |
| **App** | `src/app/` | `domain/`, `app/` | `ui/` |
| **UI** | `src/ui/` | `domain/`, `app/`, `ui/` | — |
| **Workers** | `src/workers/` | `domain/` only | `app/`, `ui/`, React |
| **Themes** | `src/themes/` | nothing (pure CSS) | everything |

### Component Hierarchy (Atomic Design)

```
ui/atoms/ → ui/molecules/ → ui/organisms/
```

Data flows unidirectionally: **Hooks → Organism → Molecules → Atoms**.

### Import Conventions

- Use path aliases: `@/domain`, `@/app`, `@/ui` (configured in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.js`).
- Every directory exposes a barrel `index.ts`. Import from the barrel, not internal files.
- Never introduce `../../` cross-layer relative imports.

---

## 4. Path Discipline

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/domain/` | Pure, framework-agnostic game logic |
| `src/app/` | React hooks, context providers, services |
| `src/ui/atoms/` | Smallest reusable UI primitives |
| `src/ui/molecules/` | Composed atom groups |
| `src/ui/organisms/` | Full feature components |
| `src/themes/` | Lazy-loaded CSS theme files |
| `src/wasm/` | WASM AI loader + fallback |
| `src/workers/` | Web Worker entry points |
| `electron/` | Electron main + preload |
| `assembly/` | AssemblyScript source |
| `scripts/` | Build-time Node scripts |
| `public/` | Static assets (manifest, SW, offline page) |
| `dist/` | Vite build output (gitignored) |
| `release/` | Electron Builder output (gitignored) |
| `docs/` | Human-readable documentation |

Do not invent new top-level directories without explicit user instruction.

## 5. Cross-platform shell governance

This repository enforces strict shell usage rules to ensure builds and scripts run in the correct environment and to prevent cross-shell command drift.

### Linux builds and development

Linux builds and general development workflows must use **Bash**.

In this repository, Bash is normally provided through:

- **WSL: Ubuntu** (default on Windows development machines)
- native Linux environments
- CI Linux runners

Use Bash for:

- dependency installation (`pnpm install`)
- development server execution (`pnpm run dev`, `pnpm run start`)
- Vite builds (`pnpm run build`, `pnpm run preview`, `pnpm run build:preview`)
- WASM builds (`pnpm run wasm:build`, `pnpm run wasm:build:debug`)
- linting (`pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run lint:fix`)
- formatting (`pnpm run format`, `pnpm run format:check`)
- typechecking (`pnpm run typecheck`)
- validation (`pnpm run check`, `pnpm run fix`, `pnpm run validate`)
- testing (`pnpm run test`, `pnpm run test:watch`, `pnpm run test:ci`, `pnpm run test:coverage`)
- cleanup (`pnpm run clean`, `pnpm run clean:dist`, `pnpm run clean:cache`, `pnpm run clean:all`, `pnpm run reinstall`)
- Electron development mode (`pnpm run desktop:dev`, `pnpm run desktop:preview`)
- Linux Electron packaging (`pnpm run linux:build`)
- Capacitor sync (`pnpm run android:sync`, `pnpm run ios:sync`)
- general source editing, documentation, and repository maintenance

If the task is not explicitly a Windows-native or macOS-native packaging task, use Bash.

### Windows builds

Use **PowerShell** only when the task is explicitly Windows-native Electron packaging:

- `pnpm run windows:build`

PowerShell is **not** the default shell. Do not use PowerShell for installs, linting, formatting, typechecking, general Vite development, ordinary web builds, docs, cleanup, WASM builds, or Electron dev mode.

### macOS and iOS builds

Use a **native or remote macOS** environment only for:

- `pnpm run mac:build`
- `pnpm run ios:init`
- `pnpm run ios:open`
- `pnpm run ios:run`

iOS builds require Apple hardware. Never suggest iOS commands unless macOS availability is confirmed.

### Android builds

Use an **Android-capable environment** (with Android SDK) only for:

- `pnpm run android:init`
- `pnpm run android:open`
- `pnpm run android:run`

### Shell routing summary

| Environment | Tasks |
|---|---|
| **Bash** (WSL / Linux / CI) | All general development, builds, quality checks, testing, WASM, Electron dev, Linux packaging, Capacitor sync |
| **PowerShell** | `windows:build` only |
| **macOS** | `mac:build`, iOS Capacitor tasks |
| **Android SDK** | Android Capacitor tasks |

### Decision rule

Before suggesting commands, determine:

1. General development or maintenance → use **Bash**
2. Windows Electron packaging → use **PowerShell**
3. macOS Electron packaging or iOS work → use **macOS**
4. Android native work → use **Android-capable environment**
5. Everything else → use **Bash**

### Hard-stop rules

Never:
- default to PowerShell for routine development
- present PowerShell as interchangeable with Bash for ordinary tasks
- switch to PowerShell unless the task is Windows-native Electron packaging
- claim iOS tasks can run fully from Windows or WSL
- use the wrong shell when the repository already defines the correct route
- introduce cross-shell command drift (e.g., PowerShell-specific syntax in scripts intended for Bash)

### Required self-check

Before responding, verify:
- Is this an ordinary dev task? → use **Bash** (WSL: Ubuntu on Windows)
- Is this specifically Electron Windows packaging? → use **PowerShell**
- Is this specifically Electron macOS packaging or iOS work? → use **macOS**
- Is this Android native work? → use **Android-capable environment**
- Otherwise → use **Bash**

## 6. Language, Syntax, and Script Governance

### Approved primary languages

The preferred and authoritative implementation languages for this repository are:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- AssemblyScript
- WebAssembly

These languages are the default choice for implementation, tooling, examples, refactors, and new code unless a higher-precedence governance file explicitly authorizes another language.

### Language priority order

When choosing how to implement something, prefer this order:

1. TypeScript
2. JavaScript
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. AssemblyScript
6. WebAssembly

Interpretation:
- Use **TypeScript** for application logic when the project already supports it
- Use **JavaScript** only where the repository already uses JavaScript or where TypeScript is not required
- Use **HTML** and **CSS** for structure and presentation
- Use **AssemblyScript** only for the WASM pipeline and related performance-sensitive modules already governed by the repo
- Use **WebAssembly** only through the repository's existing WASM build path and architecture

### Default implementation rule

Before creating new code, first ask:

- Can this be done in the existing TypeScript or JavaScript application layer?
- Can this be done inside the current HTML/CSS frontend?
- Does this belong in the existing AssemblyScript/WASM path already defined by the repository?

If yes, do that.
Do not introduce a different language or runtime.

### No orphaned scripts rule

Do not create one-off scripts, helper files, or ad hoc automation in random languages.

Never introduce orphaned scripts in languages outside the approved stack unless explicitly requested.

Examples of disallowed drift unless explicitly authorized:
- Python helper scripts
- Bash utilities added when the task belongs in package scripts or existing Node tooling
- PowerShell utilities for ordinary project logic
- Ruby, PHP, Perl, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Lua, or other side-language helpers
- duplicate build scripts outside the current package-driven workflow
- standalone conversion or codegen scripts in a different language when TypeScript or JavaScript can do the job

If automation is needed:
- first prefer an existing `package.json` script
- then prefer a Node-based script in the existing repo conventions
- then prefer TypeScript or JavaScript in the existing scripts/tooling structure
- only use another language if governance explicitly authorizes it

### No parallel toolchain rule

Do not create parallel implementations of the same concern in multiple languages.

Examples:
- do not add a Python build helper when the repo already uses Node scripts
- do not add a shell script that duplicates an existing `package.json` script
- do not add a second config format or second linter pipeline when the repo already has one
- do not create duplicate wrappers around existing Vite, Electron, Capacitor, or WASM workflows

There should be one clear implementation path per responsibility.

### File placement and responsibility rule

New files must live in the correct existing system.

Use:
- `src/` for app code
- `src/domain/` for pure domain logic
- `src/app/` for hooks, orchestration, services, side effects, and context
- `src/ui/` for UI components
- `assembly/` for AssemblyScript sources
- `scripts/` for approved Node-based build or tooling scripts already aligned with repository conventions
- `public/` for static assets
- config files only where the repository already expects them

Do not create random utility scripts at repository root.
Do not create `misc/`, `temp/`, `helpers/`, `scripts2/`, `tools-old/`, or other undisciplined folders.
Do not scatter automation across multiple languages.

### Preferred syntax rule

When generating code, prefer the syntax and style already established by the repository:
- modern TypeScript and JavaScript syntax
- ESM module syntax
- existing import/export conventions
- existing lint and format rules
- existing Vite and Node-compatible patterns
- existing AssemblyScript and WASM integration path

Do not introduce alternate syntax styles or unrelated framework conventions.

### Language selection decision rule

Before writing code, determine the correct language from this order:

1. If the feature belongs to the frontend app, prefer **TypeScript**
2. If the repository already uses JavaScript for that subsystem, follow the existing pattern
3. If the task is markup or styling, use **HTML/CSS**
4. If the task belongs to the existing WASM pipeline, use **AssemblyScript** and the existing WASM build path
5. Only use raw **WebAssembly** or WASM-adjacent outputs where the repository already expects them

If the task can be handled in the approved languages, do not introduce another language.

### Configuration and tooling rule

Prefer repository-native tooling already present in the project:
- Vite
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Vitest
- Electron
- Capacitor
- AssemblyScript
- Node-based scripts
- pnpm package scripts

Do not add alternative tooling stacks that increase fragmentation.

### Refactor rule

When refactoring:
- consolidate toward the approved languages
- reduce script sprawl
- remove duplication where appropriate
- do not migrate code into a new language without explicit instruction
- prefer folding small orphaned logic into the existing TypeScript/JavaScript structure

### Documentation rule

When documenting workflows:
- describe the primary path using the approved languages and current toolchain
- do not document unofficial side-language workflows
- do not present alternative runtimes as equal options when they are not approved

### Anti-orphan-script policy

Every new script must satisfy all of the following:

- it solves a real repository need
- it belongs to the approved language stack
- it fits the existing project structure
- it is callable from the existing package-script workflow when appropriate
- it does not duplicate an existing script, config, or toolchain
- it has a clear long-term owner and purpose

If a proposed script fails any of these checks, do not create it.

### Hard-stop rules

Never:
- introduce non-approved languages for ordinary repository tasks
- create helper scripts in random languages
- create duplicate build or tooling paths
- scatter automation across multiple runtimes
- bypass the existing TypeScript/JavaScript/AssemblyScript/WASM architecture
- invent a second way to do the same task when the repo already has a governed path

---

## 7. Minimal-Change Principle

- Modify only what the user requested.
- Do not refactor, reformat, or reorganize code beyond the scope of the task.
- Do not add dependencies, files, or scripts unless explicitly asked.
- Do not remove existing functionality to "simplify" unless instructed.
- Preserve existing code style, naming conventions, and file organization.

---

## 8. Response Contract

When producing code or commands:
1. **Use pnpm** — never npm, npx, or yarn.
2. **Respect layer boundaries** — never import across forbidden boundaries.
3. **Use path aliases** — `@/domain/...`, `@/app/...`, `@/ui/...`.
4. **Use existing scripts** — prefer `pnpm <script>` from package.json over raw CLI commands.
5. **Target the correct shell** — see §5.
6. **Cite governance** — if a user request would violate governance, explain which rule blocks it and suggest a compliant alternative.

---

## 9. Self-Check Before Every Response

Before emitting any code, command, or file change, verify:

- [ ] Am I using `pnpm` (not npm/npx/yarn)?
- [ ] Does my import respect the layer boundary table in §3?
- [ ] Am I using path aliases, not relative cross-layer imports?
- [ ] Am I targeting the correct shell/environment per §5?
- [ ] Am I using an approved language per §6?
- [ ] Am I avoiding orphaned scripts and parallel toolchains per §6?
- [ ] Does every new script pass the anti-orphan-script policy in §6?
- [ ] Am I modifying only what was requested per §7?
- [ ] Does my output match an existing `package.json` script where applicable?

If any check fails, fix it before responding.
